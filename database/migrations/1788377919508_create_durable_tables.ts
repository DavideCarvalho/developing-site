/**
 * Durable workflow tables for the @adonis-agora/durable `lucid` state store: runs, step checkpoints,
 * the search-attribute side-table, signal waiters, buffered signals and buffered events.
 *
 * This migration DELEGATES to the library instead of reproducing its DDL. The schema belongs to the
 * library — `LucidStateStore` decides what columns it reads and writes — so a hand-copied snapshot
 * here can only ever be right until the next release. It was wrong before: the stub shipped without
 * `last_heartbeat_at` / `heartbeat_progress`, which the store writes on every step beat, and nothing
 * failed only because the provider's boot-time `ensureSchema()` silently `ALTER`ed them in. Calling
 * `createDurableTables` makes that drift impossible rather than merely tested for.
 *
 * `createDurableTables` is idempotent (`hasTable` / `hasColumn` guarded) and additive-only, so it is
 * safe to run against a database that already has some or all of the tables.
 *
 * `db` (the `Database` manager from `@adonisjs/lucid/services/db`) rather than `this.db`:
 * `createDurableTables` needs `db.connection(name).schema`, and the `this.db` a migration gets is a
 * `QueryClientContract` — one already-resolved client, with no `.connection()`. `this.db` still
 * supplies the connection NAME, so `node ace migration:run --connection=x` provisions the tables on
 * connection `x` and not on the default.

   * open for this migration. With `pool: { max: 1 }` (Adonis's own SQLite guidance) that transaction
   * would hold the only connection while `createDurableTables` waited for a free one, and the
   * migration would hang until the acquire timeout. Nothing is lost by opting out: the statements were
   * never inside that transaction anyway, and re-running an interrupted `createDurableTables` is a
   * no-op.
